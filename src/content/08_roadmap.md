## FAQ

<div class="collapse collapse-plus bg-base-100 border border-base-300 text-lg">
  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Is Snippet Curator really free? What's the catch?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">
  Yes. I made it for myself and use it everyday and decided that other people should use it too because of how good it is (pat myself on the back).

<div class="collapse collapse-plus bg-base-100 border border-base-300 text-lg">
  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Will there ever be paid features or planned subscriptions?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">
  I don't have plans to limit any function behind a paywall. If there's enough request, I may consider a sync service to support development. But the software itself will always be free.

  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Plans for mobile apps?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">
  They are difficult to make. I think if there are enough requests, the first step is to make sync service to allow syncing between devices and then mobile apps after that.

  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Any plans to make its own web clipper?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">At the moment, no. SingleFile currently does pretty much everything Evernote clipper can do.</div>

  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">What's the best way to use Discover?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">It's personal preference. I've found, however, it's easiest to rate things as you go. I'll usually use my left hand to navigate between notes and right hand to rate notes if I'm on a computer.</div>
