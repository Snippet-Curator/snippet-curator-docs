## FAQ

  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Is Snippet Curator really free?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">
  Yes, and it's open source. I made it for myself and use it everyday and decided that other people should use it too because of how good it is (pat myself on the back).

  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Will there ever be paid features or planned subscriptions?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">
  I don't have plans to limit any function behind a paywall. If enough people use it, I may consider a sync service to support development. But the software itself will always be free.

  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Plans for mobile apps?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">
  They are difficult to make. I think if there are enough requests, the first step is to make sync service to allow syncing between devices and then mobile apps after that.

  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Any plan to make its own web clipper?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">At the moment, no. SingleFile currently does pretty much everything Evernote clipper can do. Making a web clipper from scratch would takes years of effort to have something of similar polish.</div>

  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Any plan to add AI for ranking notes in Discover section?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content">No. I like things the way it is right now. You have more control over exactly how the algorithm works. It's more private and less bloated.</div>
