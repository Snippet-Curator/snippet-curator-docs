## Compared to Evernote

Snippet Curator is most similar to Evernote in that it imports the full HTML content. Many other tools will save stripped down version of the webpage or only provide links to an image or video.

It provides similar way of organization through notebooks and tags.

It differs from Evernote in that it is not a note taking tool. It also does not have its own web clippers. You have to either import files from Evernote, desktop, or use SingleFile's extension to save webpages. 

## Compared to Anki

Snippet Curator took inspiration from Anki's spaced repetition. In fact, I used to export Evernote notes into Anki cards to re-discover them. 

However, I found Anki's way of reviewing cards often punitive: if you miss a day or two, the cards can pile up easily. I also just don't like the idea of having due dates on something I'm viewing for fun. Snippet Curator, on the other hand, presents saves in a more casual viewing way.  

## Bookmarking Tools

There are numerous other tools for saving websites (e.g., [Karakeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep), [ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io/)). In fact, I use Karakeep with Snippet Curator together. However, I think they differ in philosophy.

I think of bookmark sites as primarily links to webpages, with backup function in case the link dies. Full pages are often archived with or without screenshot. 

Snippet Curator, on the other hand, is a library of saved items. You import only what you need (just the snippet and not the full page). But what you imported is directly viewable without leaving the app. The original URL is there only if you want to visit.   

I use Karakeep as my bookmarking tool and save items to Snippet Curator as part of my permanent collection.
