## wat this is

The idea is to have a personal, private collection of internet items that you can revisit. Your own pinterest, or instagram saves, or bookmarklet with all of the pages saved.

Instead of being a bookmark site, where if the oringal site is deleted, your bookmark is obsolte. 

What's presented in Recollect is actually saved to your computer. 

 ## What this is not
 - not a note taking tool
 - not a clipper.


## How this differs from others

### Other archival tools

- other bookmark sites offer similar function of saving a snapshot of the page. This is limited in 2 ways: 
 - the entire page is saved. Sometimes I just want to the one item or one section and not the entire page
 - sites requiring loggin will have limited snapshot ability. Whereas recollect uses Singlefile or Evernote clipper
