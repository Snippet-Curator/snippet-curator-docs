Discovery is based on how recent a note is viewed, its rating, and its weight. 

- recency: this is based on how recent the note was last viewed. Older notes are scored higher. Notes that have not been viewed before are scored higher.
- rating: from 1 to 5. Notes without a rating are treated with rating of 2.5. Think of rating as more of a longterm score modifier (e.g. I like this note and will continue to like this note). 
- upvote/downvote: from 0 to 10. Notes without a weight are treated with weight of 5. Use weight as more of a short term score modifier (e.g., I like this note but just want to see it less).

The idea is to present notes in a somewhat to preferentially show older notes, higher rated notes, and higher weighted notes, with some sprinkled randomness.
