## Sections and Notebooks

The default sections are as follows:

- **Discover**: discover your notes based on note scores.
- **Search**: this is default view. It includes all of your notes, as well as ability to search.
- **Inbox**: this is the default import Notebook. Notes without notebooks are also moved here.
- **Archive**: archived notes. These will still show up in search.
- **Trash**: deleted notes. These will not show up with search.

## Quick Navigation

Use `ctrl` + `l` anywhere in the app to bring up the quick navigation box:

This allows you to quickly find notebook or tags. You can also use it to navigate to other sections including **Discover**, **Import**, and **Settings**.
