Snippet Curator is open source and provided for free. You can download the latest version for Mac or Windows:

<a href="https://github.com/Snippet-Curator/snippet-curator-releases/releases/latest">
<button class="btn btn-primary">Download</button>
</a>

For **Windows**, look for the file ending in `.exe`.
For **Mac**, look for the file ending in `.dmg`.

If you are interested in **Linux** version, [let me know](/docs/08_roadmap).

I have managed to host it on my home server via Docker. It's possible but still needs more tinkering.

## Troubleshoot

When installing on Windows, you may run into a prompt about unrecognized app: 
![](/images/windows.png)

This message appears because the app is not code signed on Windows, a very expensive fee to pay every year. While offering the app for free, I just don't think I could justify the cost.

You can circumvent this message by clicking **More info** and click **Run Anyway**:
