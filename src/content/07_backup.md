## Backing Up Data

All of the files and database are stored under a folder called `pb_data`. You can backup the entire application by simply copying and pasting it to somewhere else when the app is not running (to avoid corrupting the database).

On **Windows**, you can access the folder by opening the file manager and typing `%APPDATA%\Snippet Curator`. 

On **Mac**, you can find this folder under `Users/{your user name}/Library/Application Support/Snippet Curator`.

In future releases, I'll add support to export notes to HTML.
