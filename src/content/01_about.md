Snippet Curator is a personal, private, and offline app that you can use to import and re-discover internet clips over time. 

Instead of links to webpages, items imported to Snippet Curator are saved and viewable offline. Even if the original webpage is deleted or you lose internet connection, your saves are still secure on your computer. 

Snippet Curator helps discovering notes by ranking each note with a score and present them based on their rating, votes, and how recently they were seen. Add items and forget them. Eventually, you'll see them again.

No data is collected from you. The app only connects to internet for updates and for Youtube embeds. AI is not used anywhere in the app. 

I made Snippet Curator for myself, as my personal alternative to Evernote and Anki.
