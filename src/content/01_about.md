Snippet Curator is a personal, private, and offline app that you can use to import and re-discover internet clips over time. 

Unlike other bookmark sites, besides embedded Youtube videos, items imported to Curator are saved offline. Even if the original webpage is deleted or you lose internet connection, your saves are still secure on your computer. Think of this more as a lightweight alternative to Evernote for web clips than Pinterest. It also differs with some of the other archival tools in that it only imports what you saved (via Evernote or SingleFile), instead of the whole page. Often times, we only want to save a small snippet of what we are reading or watching.  

Snippet Curator helps discovering notes by ranking each note with a score and present them based on their rating, votes, and how recently they were seen. Think of this as similar to Anki's space repetition. I found Anki's way of reviewing cards often punitive: if you miss a day or two, the cards can pile up easily. Snippet Curator, on the other hand, presents saves in a more casual viewing way.  

I made Snippet Curator for myself, after years of learning programming, as my personal alternative to Evernote and Anki.
